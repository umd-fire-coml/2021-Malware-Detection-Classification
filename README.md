# 2021-Malware-Detection-Classification

## Description
Malware detection is an important process in modern computing to help protect various systems from getting infected. The goal for any project, program, or system that aims to detect malware is to prevent any malicious software from running on a user’s computer. With our project, we have aimed to assist in the battle against malicious software by creating a model that can detect and label different types of programs as either malware or benign software. For this project, we used a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model.

The architecture of our model, shown above, consists of a dense layer with relu activation, a batch normalization layer, and finally a dropout layer. As shown in the diagram, we use 10 of these layers. This project takes inspiration from the paper “Malware Analysis with Artificial Intelligence and a Particular Attention on Results Interpretability” created by Benjamin Marais, Tony Quertier, and Christophe Chesneau.

## Training Instructions (To Start Training Process & Get Trained Weights)
 ```

        epoch_loss_avg.update_state(loss_value)  # Add current batch loss
        # Compare predicted label to actual label
        # training=True is needed only if there are layers with different
        # behavior during training versus inference (e.g. Dropout).

    # End epoch
    train_loss_results.append(epoch_loss_avg.result())

    if epoch % 50 == 0:

            epoch, epoch_loss_avg.result(), epoch_accuracy.result()))

    fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, sharex=True, figsize=(12, 8))
    fig.suptitle('Training Metrics')

    axes[0].set_ylabel("Loss", fontsize=14)
    axes[0].plot(train_loss_results)

    axes[1].set_ylabel("Accuracy", fontsize=14)
    axes[1].set_xlabel("Epoch", fontsize=14)
    axes[1].plot(train_accuracy_results)
    plt.show()

## Model Instructions (To Test & Get Predicted Results)
The test script is incomplete, however if it was finished it would have used our model weights in order to predict and label the software as either malicious or benign
